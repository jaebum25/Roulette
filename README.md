## Patch v1 Notes

This is the initial launch of Ghoulette. With respect to this launch date 11.11.22 - let's take a moment to remember and thank those who made a sacrifice for our freedom. Thanks for reading and see you for the next patch.

## Background info:

This is a project I started for a Software Engineering bootcamp @GeneralAssembly.
Ghoulette is a spinoff of the popular casino game 'Roulette'.
I've added quotes on the background as decoration. These are inspired from anything related to the current theme of the project.

## Description:

### Theme: Halloween/The Riddler

### To play the game:

1. Select your chip, this will be your bet
2. Place your bet on board. You can bet as much as you have a $balance for.
3. When you're ready, hit the 'Trick or Treat!' button.
4. If the number and/or color matches where you have placed your bet, you win. if not, the house keeps the bets that did not match with the winning number/color.
5. The game stops when your balance hits $0. From there you can send me an e-transfer or simply refresh the page to start again at the default $100.

### Odds Payout Chart:

- match any number: 11:1
- orange (treat): 3:1
- black (trick): 0



## Icebox items:

1. Expand on betting options (more numbers, sections, odd/even)
2. You can't see your bets placed or undo it, but it fits the spooky theme of Halloween. I feel people may find this inconvenient and I will definitely consider displaying your bet and size placed on the board, as well as a clear bets/undo button.
3. The whole point of this game is to see a ball roll around a wheel right?? This seems like an advanced CSS feature that I will look to explore and implement when I have more time available to R&D.
4. Gambling can really make your mental boom, so I intend to put some calming background music available.
5. Sound fx may enhance user experience.
6. Theme is set to change to suit the current vibes of the season.
